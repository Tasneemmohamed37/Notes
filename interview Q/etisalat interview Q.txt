- instead of fixed hight -> give parent & child h-100

- 1. can we customize padding & margine for select tag -> no, so best to use *ngSelect

- 2. var VS let VS const ?
	 - var hoisting is undefind 
	 - let, const hoisting with consediring TDZ 'temperale data zone'
	 
- 3. Closures 
	 what output of two given loops iterate from 1 to 4
	 first only log i  -> declare iteration with var or let the output will be same '1 2 3 4'  
	 second include set time out 'async task will execute in web api' -> with var 'func scope' will get '4 4 4 4'
																	  -> with let 'block scope' get '1 2 3 4'
																	  
																	  
- 4. array VS set 

- 5. map Vs foreach

- 6. optional chaining '?' to handle nullish values

- 7. nullish values VS falsy values
		commnly used with nullish coalescing operator

- 8. strict equality operator VS loose
		- loose commnly used for check id getted from route, becouse 100% id is num so it safe 
		كومارشان؟؟؟

- 9. shallow copy VS deep (spreed operators | json.stringfy)

- 10. concurrency model, event loop, web api, call stack, callback queue, event queue, macro task, single thrid 

- 11. observable VS promise

- 12. component incapsulation -> emulated using uniqe attr
							  -> shadow dom
							  -> none 
							  
- 13. in case want to send data between not related components? use observable

- 14. in case send obj from parent to child using @input & onChange, data not send why?? 
		prob -> obj located in heap so with each chang will send obj ref which not changed so will not call onChange
		solve -> deep copy for obj using spreed operators then send it
