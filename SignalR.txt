- to make website real time have multiple technics -> 1. polling -> setInterval include ajax request to check if there is new data
																 -> prob : server headache
												   -> 2. long polling -> server have requests till change occure then response
																	  -> prob : connection time out
												   -> 3. forever frame -> depend on chunked encoding 'http bug' which send response part by part but unknown part numbers 
																	   -> client send only one request and every time server has new data send it in chunk 
																	   -> prob : 'one way' only work to recieve data, in case want to send must stop forever frame first & only work on microsoft browser
												   -> 4. server sent event 'api' -> client subscribe and server publish when event fires 
																				 -> prob : one way & not work on ie browser
												   -> 5. webSocket -> new protocol depend on 'tcp/ip' will open channel between server and client 
																   -> first request knowen as 'hand shack' send using http 
																   -> prob : only work with os and browsers publich on 2012 ot latest 
												
- SignalR -> write code once in c# 'hub' then by using 'connection layer' will deciede suitable tech for server and client  
		  -> to call this function use proxy class 'class similar to hub class using client side technologies'
		  -> using 'RPC' remote procedur calling which allow server side to call client side function
		  -> 1. in class program allow DI for signalr [$ builder.services.addSignalr()]
		  -> 2. add class 'chathub' which inhairete class 'hub'
		  -> 3. add middleware for created class [$ app.maphub<chathub>("/chat")]
		  -> 4. in client side -> add signalr client library 
							   -> define connection url so by defualt create proxy 
							   -> start connection
							   -> call server method 'service method'
							   -> define callback func 'subscribe broadcasting'
